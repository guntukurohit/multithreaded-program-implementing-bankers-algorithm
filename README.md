# multithreaded-program-implementing-bankers-algorithm
using bankers_program we can implement the general process scheduling (without using any threads).
using_threads.c file implements the program using the threads.
while implementation of this program pass the number of resources of each type on the command line.
Example ./a.out 10 5 7
here 10, 5 ,7 are the instances of each resource type.
